## About Reading List

Reading List is a lightweight yet powerful reading tracker and planner, available for iOS and iPadOS.

Reading List is designed to make it incredibly easy to plan what to read, to track your reading progress, and to record information about the books you have read. Books can be easily added via barcode scan or online search, and all metadata is configurable. Users can add their own notes and ratings, and use the powerful organisation functions to create their own lists of books.

Reading List is designed to be a clear and accessible personal book log; it follows the iOS human interface guidelines to bring a design which is intuitive and beautiful. The app is fully functional when offline; when online data synchronises seamlessly between multiple devices via iCloud. With iOS 14, users can place their books on their homescreen for even faster access.

Reading List has been a free app since 2017, and has a growing and passionate userbase. On 7th April 2021, version 2.0 was released, bringing the biggest updates yet.

Alternative app icons and theme overrides, for more control over how Reading List looks.

Support for multiple windows on iPadOS, for more powerful library management on iPad.

# About Reading List

Reading List is a free iPhone and iPad app, which exists to track your personal reading. It provides a place to record a list of books you want to read, alongside a journal of the books you are reading or have finished. You can also add a star rating and personal notes to each book, as well as curating your own custom lists.

Reading List has a clear and simple design, with a deliberately concise set of features, which makes performing common actions easy and quick. Adding new books can be done effortlessly by scanning a physical barcode or searching online. Recording the start or completion date of a book can be performed with a single swipe – much like marking an email as Read. It is a deliberate decision that the app doesn’t have a social network component or give book recommendations. It aims to be _solely_ a reading journal app.

I had the idea for this app in late 2015 after I became frustrated with the limitations and annoyances of similar book-tracking apps, such as Goodreads. When I couldn't find an alternative app which I really liked, I took the opportunity to learn about programming on Apple platforms (I program on Microsoft platforms for my day job) with the programming language [Swift](https://swift.org/). Reading List was released on the App Store in July 2017.

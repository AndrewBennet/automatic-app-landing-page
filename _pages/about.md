# About Reading List

Reading List is a free iPhone and iPad app, which exists to track your personal reading. It provides a place to record a list of books you want to read, alongside a journal of the books you are reading or have finished. You can also add a star rating and personal notes to each book, as well as curate your own custom lists.

Reading List has a clear and simple design, with a deliberately concise set of features, which makes performing common actions quick and easy. Adding new books is effortless, by scanning a physical barcode or searching online. Logging the start or completion of a book can be performed with a single swipe – much like marking an email as Read. It is a deliberate decision that the app doesn’t have a social network component or give book recommendations: it aims to be _solely_ a reading journal app, and aims to do it well.

I had the idea for this app in late 2015 after I became frustrated with similar book-tracking apps, such as Goodreads. When I couldn't find an alternative app which I really liked, I took the opportunity to learn about programming on Apple platforms (I program on Microsoft platforms for my day job) in the programming language [Swift](https://swift.org/). Reading List is open source, available under the [GNU GPL v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html) licence on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewBennet/ReadingList). Reading List was first released on the App Store in July 2017.

# About Reading List

Reading List is a free iPhone and iPad app to track your personal reading habits. It provides a place to record a list of books you want to read, alongside a journal of the books you are reading or have finished. You can also add a star rating and personal notes to each book, as well as curate your own custom lists.

Reading List has a simple design that focuses on clarity and usability, making common tasks quick and easy to perform. Adding new books is effortless, by scanning a barcode or searching online. Logging the start or completion of a book can be performed with a single swipe â€“ much like marking an email as Read. And the whole of your reading journal can be synchronised in real-time via iCloud between iPhone and iPad devices. The ease of use of Reading List makes tracking your reading habit effortless.
